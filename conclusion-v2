	Humans understand AND and OR gates easily because we use the concepts of “and” and “or” in our everyday lives. However, in terms of circuitry, they are not ideal. Any logic function can be created using only NAND gates or NOR gates, including inverters and XORs. NAND and NOR gates also use only two transistors, while AND and OR require three. In conclusion, using NAND and NOR gates over AND and OR in circuits is advantageous in their performance and simplicity.
